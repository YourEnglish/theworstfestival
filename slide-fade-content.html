		DUNE RATS (AUS) are masters in creating songs that bring you sheer joy and the pleasures of an ecstatic crowd. To be sure, these 3 hyperactive stoner cunts from Brisbane didn't come here for a hair cut. Vocalist/guitarist Danny Beus, drummer BC Michaels &amp; bassist Brett Jansch are the inventors of DUNECORE stoner pop, an energetic and happy mix of indie/jangle/surf/garage rock. Never shy of a fine prank they remain the crowd pleasers you have been waiting for.</br>

		<p>MOLLY (DK) Who doesn&#39;t like a band, who arranges their own concerts in legendary Cph-venues like Floss Bar and Rockmaskinen and whose lead singer Malte Hill has exactly 666 Facebook friends. So when international media, like <a href="http://noisey.vice.com/en_se/blog/if-you-love-power-pop-youre-gonna-love-mollys-new-video-for-bagu-bagu" target="_blank">Noisey</a> and <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2015/03/listen_to_danis.html" target="_blank">Brooklyn Vegan</a>, are also raving about their music, there is no reason to stay at home when they are playing at KB18. Come out and see Molly play their first concert after their debut album release &quot;Peach Melba&quot;.</p>

		<p>EERIE GLUE (DK) When we in 2020 are making the Dune Rats movie, we already know who we should hire as actors for the roles of the Dune Rats&#39; personal assistants; Bünyamin, Bjørn, Malthe and Mikael. They look like they have just walked away from the filmset of Pulp Fiction. We feel already a bit sorry for the crowd in front of the stage. In every aspect a very impressive band, performing their self proclaimed <a href="https://soundcloud.com/benjamin-eroglu/sets/lazy-laments-ep" target="_blank">Horror Fuzz Love Pop</a>. See you at the front row!</p>

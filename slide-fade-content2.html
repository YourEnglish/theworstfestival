		<p>GENTS is a duo from Copenhagen, who play pop music centered around a deep soft croon. Despite this being only their third concert, they have confirmed the people at The Worst Festival, that with only a few tools they are able to make both atmospheric, kitsch and catchy popmusic, which complements the two DIY bands very well.
